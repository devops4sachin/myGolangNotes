################ Installing Go #################

###### 6. Installation Insights

	Installation Insights
	download go; run sha1 checksum openssl sha1; uninstall any old versions; install new version
	download go
	sha1 checksum
	uninstall old version
	install new version
	go version


###### 7. Go Workspace

	- Learn the importance of your Go workspace. Learn how to configure your Go workspace. Learn about namespacing, the importance of namespacing, and how Go implements namespacing.
	- Only one folder - any name, any location
		bin
		pkg
		src
			github.com
			<github.com username>
			folder with code for project / repo
			folder with code for project / repo
			folder with code for project / repo
			folder with code for project / repo
			...
			folder with code for project / repo
	- namespacing
	- # go get github_location_for_go_repo
	- package management


###### 8. Environment Variables

	- # go env
		GOROOT = installation path where go is installed
		GOPATH = To your workspace
		GOBIN = Where you want all the bin to land in

###### 9. Windows - Configuring Path Variables

	- computer / properties / advanced system settings / environment variables / 
		googling for location on different windows versions
		search box in windows
		user variables vs system variables
	- set GOPATH variable
		copying the path from windows explorer
	- set GOROOT
	- Setting a PATH variable to your bin
		set "C:\Sachin_Folder\GoProjects\bin" to your env variable, so that the go .exe can be run directly.
	

###### 10. Mac - Configuring Path Variables

	- Set variable in the "bash_profile"
		# cd ~
		# users home
		# ls -la
		# hidden files
		# .bash_profile
		# .bashrc
			export GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
			export GOPATH="$HOME/GoPrograms/"
			export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/GoPrograms/bin"	-- So that the go exe can be executed directly
				
		# nano
