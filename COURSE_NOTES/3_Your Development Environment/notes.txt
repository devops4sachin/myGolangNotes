###### 22. Hello World with Webstorm

###### 23. The Go Command & Documentation

	- Documentation for go command:
		# go help command
		# go help fmt
			PS C:\Sachin_Folder\GoProjects\src\mygoprograms> go help fmt
			usage: go fmt [-n] [-x] [packages]
		
			Fmt runs the command 'gofmt -l -w' on the packages named
			by the import paths. It prints the names of the files that are modified.
			
		- https://golang.org/cmd/go : search for the command
		
	- go run
		needs a file name, eg, go run main.go
	- go build
		for an executable:
			builds the exe file
			reports errors, if any
			if there are no errors, it puts an executable into the current folder
		for a package:
			builds the file
			reports errors, if any
			throws away binary
	- go install
		for an executable:
			compiles the program (builds it)
			names the executable the folder name holding the code
			puts the executable in workspace / bin
				$GOPATH / bin
		for a package:
			compiles the package (builds it)
			puts the executable in workspace / pkg
				GOPATH / pkg
			it an archive file
	- go clean : It removes the executable that was generated from the current folder.

		- from terminal
			git status
			git add --all
			git commit -m “first commit”
