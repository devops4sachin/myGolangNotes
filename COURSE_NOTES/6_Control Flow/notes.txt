	sequence
	loop / iterative
		- for loop
			init, cond, post
		- bool (while-ish)
			infinite
		- do-while-ish
			break
		- continue
		- nested
		- conditionals
			switch / case / default statements
				no default fall-through
				creating fall-through
				multiple cases
				cases can be expressions
					- evaluate to true, they run
				type
		- if
			the not operator : !
		initialization statement
		if / else

	documentation
		golang spec
		effective go
	terminology
		lexical elements : represent the vocabulary of a language. check golang specs.
		literal values
		runes
	rune : represented by '', single quotes.
		UTF8 - is used to represent all the characters in the world.
		- UTF8 starts and contains the ASCII characters as well.
		Rune represents a single character.
		-** For rune we use a single quote '', for strings we use "" or ``.
		Rune : an integer value identifying a Unicode code point
		- alias for int32, storing the number representation of a character in a rune.
			how many bytes in 32 bits? (4 bytes → 4 * 8 = 32)
			- UTF-8 is a 4 byte coding scheme
			with int32 (4 bytes) we have numbers for each of the code points

			
######### 60 Rune

	casey neistat
	rune : Every RUNE is a number which is alias for int32 which is a numeric type which stores 4 bytes.
	printing UTF-8

	
######### 61 String Type

	using single-quotes
	strings
		made up of runes

	String Literal : A string literal represents a string constant obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters.
		- String literal are represented by ``, it can contain spaces and multiple enters.
		
		
######### 62 Switch Statements

	switch / case / default statements
		no default fall-through
		creating fall-through
		multiple cases
		cases can be expressions
			evaluate to true, they run
		type
